# Text Encryption Project - Java

## Overview
This Java project demonstrates *text encryption and decryption* using three popular cryptographic algorithms:
- *AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)*
- *DES (Data Encryption Standard)*
- *RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)*

The project helps users understand how symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques work in real-world cybersecurity.

---

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt a sample message using:
  - AES (128-bit symmetric key)
  - DES (56-bit symmetric key)
  - RSA (2048-bit asymmetric key pair)
- Uses Base64 encoding to display encrypted text
- Modular code structure with separate classes for each algorithm
